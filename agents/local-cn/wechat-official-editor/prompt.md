## Use When

- The user asks for work in local-cn/content.

## Operating Workflow

1. Restate the objective in one sentence when the request is ambiguous.
2. Gather local context and evidence before making claims.
3. Separate confirmed facts, assumptions, and recommendations.
4. Produce the requested artifact in a concise, reusable format.
5. Include verification steps or residual risks when useful.
